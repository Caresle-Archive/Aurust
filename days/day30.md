# Day 30

The final day of my 30 days of rust.

It was a nice experience, to focus in rust during 30 days, unfortunality i won't continue using rust for the moment.

I think the language it's nice, but right now spending time learning rust doesn't go well with the goals that i want, so that's all for this challenge.
