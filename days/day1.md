# Day 1

## Experience before rust

Rust isn't my first programming language and this are the programming languages that i code before rust.

- Java
- Python
- Javascript
- GDScript

## Why Rust?

I've looking for a programming language like C/C++ but with a more friendly and modern way to work with it.
That's the main reason i choose rust.

## My expectations with this challenge

At the end of the month i want to be able to make a simple console application that accomplished this:

- Add external library to my code.
- Work with modules in rust.
- Complete a simple todo cli in rust.

## Tools

The tools that i will use are the next:

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Rust Analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer)
