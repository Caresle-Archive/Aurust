## What i learn

Today i started a little project to convert rgb values to hexadecimal code.

The first thing that i did was to learn how to convert from decimal to hexadecimal.
I will no use any external crate, only vanilla rust.

Also i read the last section of the microsoft course [Take your first steps with Rust](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/rust-first-steps/). It's a great starting point, of course you will need to add some information with youtube videos and the rust book, but for learning the basis of how to work with rust it's great.

Here it's my summary of the course:

- I liked:
	- How it's explained the error handling in rust
	- How to add test to the code
	- How to implement traits and generic types
	- The easy that some topic are explained
- I will add:
	- A little more explanation in the ownership and borrowing system of rust
	- More examples in the modules, packages, and third party crates

And one of the last things that i did, it was to see some examples of the repo of rylev of `learn rust the hard way`
